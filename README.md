# Fish Species Identification in Video Stream Using YOLO Model

This project uses a YOLO model trained to identify four fish species:

- **Carcinus maenas** (European Green Crab)
- **Ctenolabrus rupestris** (Goldsinny Wrasse)
- **Gobius niger** (Black Goby)
- **Neogobius melanostomus** (Round Goby)

## Usage

To test the model on a video stream, run the following command:

```bash
python3 test.py


### Key Features:
- Uses **YOLO** object detection model.
- Trained to recognize **four distinct species** in video streams.

This format is GitHub-friendly and follows standard `README.md` conventions. Let me know if you'd like any further tweaks!
